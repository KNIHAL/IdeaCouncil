# ðŸ§  Prompt Strategies for IdeaCouncil AI

## ðŸ‘¥ Role-Goal-Backstory Alignment

Each agent was defined with:
- **Role** â†’ Domain-specific identity
- **Goal** â†’ Clear mission for evaluation
- **Backstory** â†’ Persona context to improve reasoning and consistency

## ðŸ”„ Input Chaining

- The Chief agent first breaks the user idea into structured parts
- That structure is passed as input to all domain managers
- Each domain manager sends the same to their experts

This guarantees **tight focus and no prompt confusion**.

## ðŸ§± Delegation & Hierarchy

Managers are allowed to delegate, sub-agents are not. This keeps decision-making centralized while allowing distribution of analysis.

## ðŸ§  Prompting Style

- Always ask for structured output: bullet points, numbered sections
- Use task-specific terms: "Evaluate cost structure", not just "analyze"

## ðŸ“Œ Example

> "Review the startup's pricing model, revenue logic, and monetization plans."
